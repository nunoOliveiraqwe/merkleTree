# Merkle Tree 


## Introduction

This repository contains a Java implementation of a Merkle tree, designed to facilitate conflict identification across network bounds, especially when nodes go down. The Merkle tree is a data structure widely used in distributed systems and blockchain technologies to efficiently verify the integrity of large datasets. I created this project because I couldn't find a suitable straightforward implementation that met my specific requirements. While I drew inspiration from Cassandra's implementation, their code was too complex and tailored to their system. Other existing implementations either lacked the flexibility I needed or were in different programming languages.

## Features

- **Customizable Hashing**: My Merkle tree implementation allows users to choose any type of hash for any type of data. Both the hash function and the object are template parameters, providing flexibility to adapt the tree to specific use cases.

- **Straightforward Approach**: Unlike some existing implementations, this Merkle tree is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand. I aimed to strike a balance between simplicity and functionality to ensure developers can quickly grasp and utilize it.

- **Conflict Identification**: The Merkle tree efficiently identifies conflicts across network bounds. When nodes go down and reconnect, this tree can help in verifying the integrity of data, minimizing data synchronization issues.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with using the Merkle tree in your projects:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/nunoOliveiraqwe/merkleTree.git
```

2. **Use the Merkle Tree**:

## Example Usage

```java
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    private static class ByteArray implements Comparable<ByteArray> {
        // ... (Refer to code example above for the full implementation)
    }

    private static class HashableImpl implements Hashable<ByteArray>, Comparable<HashableImpl> {
        // ... (Refer to code example above for the full implementation)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of HashableImpl objects
        List<HashableImpl> elements = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            elements.add(new HashableImpl(i));
        }

        // Sort the elements (required for Merkle tree construction)
        Collections.sort(elements);

        // Create the Merkle tree using a custom hash function
        MerkleTree<ByteArray, HashableImpl> refTree = new MerkleTree<>(elements, hashes -> {
            MessageDigest md5 = null;
            try {
                md5 = MessageDigest.getInstance("md5");
            } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
            MessageDigest finalMd = md5;
            hashes.forEach(h -> finalMd.update(h.array));
            return new ByteArray(md5.digest());
        });

        // TODO: Use the 'refTree' for conflict identification or any other purpose.
    }

    // Define the MerkleTree class (if not already defined) with necessary methods and constructors
    // ...

}
```

In this example, we've created a simple `HashableImpl` class that implements `Comparable` and `Hashable`, and a `ByteArray` class to hold the hash values. The `MerkleTree` is created using the provided list of `HashableImpl` objects, and a custom hash function that uses MD5 for demonstration purposes. You can replace the hash function with any other hashing algorithm as per your requirements.
